# package-delivery-app

The Package Delivery App is a Python application that utilizes a custom iteration of the nearest neighbor algorithm to generate an efficient package delivery route. This algorithm helps optimize the delivery route by minimizing the distance traveled.

## Features

- Efficient package delivery: The app calculates the most efficient route to deliver packages using a modified version of the nearest neighbor algorithm.
- Interactive interface: The app provides an interactive interface for inputting and managing package details and delivery trucks, as well as time stamps to view snapshots of the truck/package locations.
